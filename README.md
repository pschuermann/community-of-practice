# Communities of Practice resource list 
This page contains links to talks, podcasts, books and accademic papers about communities of practice. Inspired by Lorin's reading lists e.g. [Messiness reading list](https://github.com/lorin/messiness)

Communities are fun, amazing, very powerful and are not obvious or easy to understand. These resources can help you with that.

[Structural and Epistemic Parameters in Communities of Practice](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247824282_Structural_and_Epistemic_Parameters_in_Communities_of_Practice) talks about how organisations can support CoPs without constraining them by controlling them in a way that disrupts the dynamics that make the community work in the first place. It differentiates between different structures and the delicate balance between seeding structures and controlling structures. A few teasers:
- CoPs need seeding structure to grow
- Summarises some of the original material from Wenger of what is a CoP and how do you know one has formed.
- importance of artifacts as points of focus for people to identify and interact
- incentives and how they changed over time with a change of the structure
- danger of becoming too introspective losing touch with the wider organisation context
