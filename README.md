Granovetter + [Strong and Weak Ties](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch03.pdf) learn about the power of weak ties and why we need them.

[Structural and Epistemic Parameters in Communities of Practice](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247824282_Structural_and_Epistemic_Parameters_in_Communities_of_Practice) talks about how organisations can support CoPs without constraining them by controlling them in a way that disrupts the dynamics that make the community work in the first place. It differentiates between different structures and the delicate balance between seeding structures and controlling structures. A few teasers:
- CoPs need seeding structure to grow
- Summarises some of the original material from Wenger (he’s awesome!) of what is a CoP and how do you know one has formed.
- importance of artifacts as points of focus for people to identify and interact
- incentives and how they changed over time with a change of the structure
- danger of becoming too introspective losing touch with the wider organisation context
